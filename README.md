# Velo
## What is Velo?
Velo is a general-purpose discord bot, created using node.js.
## What are the commands?
Currently, there is no help command, but that will come very shortly. For now, you are going to have to dive through index.js.
## How can I use the bot for my own server?
At the moment, Velo is very rudimentary. However, if you still want to download and use the bot for your own server, here is how.
1. Download node.js via https://nodejs.org/en/.
2. Run `npm install discord.js`.
3. Register an app and receive your bot token at https://discordapp.com/developers/.
4. Replace `YOUR-TOKEN-HERE` with your token in config.json.
5. Run index.js.

Alternatively, you can go to https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=533050128060383252&permissions=0&scope=bot to add Velo to your server.
